  # ---------------------  IMPORTANT ---------------------------
  # Uncomment the paths below for the applications that you'd like to manage.
  # By default all the helmfiles have `install:true`. So if you uncomment one of these
  # helmfiles, the associated application will be tried to be installed or updated.
  #
  # You can set `install:false` to either uninstall the app from your cluster, or
  # keep it uninstalled if you don't have it already installed.

# DEPRECATED: cert-manager-legacy SHOULD NOT be used for new installations. It
# DOES NOT WORK on Kubernetes versions 1.20 or newer. It can be used to take
# over an existing cert-manager release from GitLab 13.x. But even then, it is
# recommneded that you upgrade as soon as possible, because it WILL BREAK on
# Kubernetes 1.20 and newer.
